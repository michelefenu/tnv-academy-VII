        <h4>ATTENZIONE! É consigliabile avere un bagno vicino se si sceglie di mangiare questa pizza</h4>
        <p>
            Sometimes a plan gone terribly wrong becomes a new plan that goes
            <br>better than anyone could have ever dreamed. Ever. That would be this pizza. 
            <br>I can’t even remember what I attempted to make which ultimately 
            <br>led me to this masterpiece. 
            <br>If I could remember there would be a thank you card involved… 
            <br>because I am grateful for this amazing pie of berry s’mores heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
            S’mores have been on my mind lately. Summer seems to be it’s season
            <br>in fact I’d say s’mores are the pumpkin to Pinterest in the fall.  
            <br>Everything from cakes to pies to cheesecakes to bars to cocktails 
            <br>and even crispy treats. Of course there is nothing shocking about this. 
            <br>It’s graham, chocolate and marshmallow we are talking about here. 
            <br>Very few people find these things repulsive.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been on the hunt for something s’mores for a couple of reasons. 
            <br>A. I needed an easy recipe, quick. B. Jettie loves to help me in the kitchen 
            <br>and I wanted something she could do almost entirely herself. 
            <br>(Which makes a 4 year old feel pretty awesome. In turn making mommy feel 
            <br>pretty awesome.) There is nothing easier to assemble than pizza…so 
            <br>I thought why not a s’mores pizza. But not just any old s’mores pizza. 
            <br>How about a s’mores pizza with raspberries and white chocolate?
        </p>
        <p>
            One warning! Do not make this alone. It’s not something that can just be sitting 
            <br>around. A person could “pick” all day before realizing they have eaten 
            <br>4 slices of dessert pie. Of course if you are a champ in the self control 
            <br>department (not me) then make away. Otherwise you may want a 
            <br>6 person cushion…or a double up workout plan for that week.
            <br>Enjoy!

        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven 425 degrees (or whatever your chosen pizza dough tells you). 
                <br>Spread dough onto a greased round pizza pan. Precook the dough according 
                <br>to the instructions and place in oven for the instructed time minus 7 minutes. 
                <br>For me that was about 11 minutes. Pull pizza out of oven.
            </li>
            <li>
                Top pizza with graham crackers, white chocolate chips next, fresh raspberries 
                <br>and then marshmallows. Pop into oven for 6 to 8 minutes or until crust is done 
                <br>and marshmallows are golden. (If marshmallows become golden before crust is 
                <br>completely cooked cover them lightly with foil for remainder of bake time.) 
                <br>Remove pizza from oven.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt dark chocolate chips in a small dish. Drizzle all over your yummy pizza. 
                <br>Serve immediately!
            </li>
